The number of grown up illiterates is great. All college and senior School students should come forward to visit villages in the summer vacation. Each one will teach one there. This will remove&#xD;&#xA;            illiteracy and strengthen our democracy.</p>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>I happened to see a one day cricket match between Pakistan and Australia at Wankhade Stadium, Mumbai. I went for a fun. But I witnessed a horrible sight. Two thousand ticketless cricket fans gate crashed. There was a stampede. Three persons died&#xD;&#xA;            and twenty were injured. Administration was responsible for it.</p>&#xD;&#xA;        </article>&#xD;&#xA;        <article>&#xD;&#xA;          <h2 class="d_active tab_drawer_heading">Tab Content Two</h2>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>City Anti-pollution Drive demands certain steps from all the citizens of ABC city. All house-holders should pack the waste in a plastic bag and put the bag in front of their house. The bag will be replaced with an empty bag by the Municipal van&#xD;&#xA;            every morning. They should maintain the cleanliness of the city. This will make the city pollution free.</p>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>My visit to a slum area after the rainy season was a sad affair. The pits were still full of rain water. There was mud all around. The polluted water had caused various diseases. There was no home without a sick person. Small children suffered from&#xD;&#xA;            stomach troubles. The government should immediately rush to the help of the sufferers in the slum area.</p>&#xD;&#xA;        </article>&#xD;&#xA;        <article>&#xD;&#xA;          <h2 class="d_active tab_drawer_heading">Tab Content Three</h2>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>I saw a man climbing down a water pipe. He had a knife in his hand. I hit his hand with a brick. He fell down on the ground and I jumped upon him. Soon others reached there and we handed him over to the police.</p>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>A tragedy took place yesterday when a Matador fell into a canal. The driver of the Matador tried to save an auto-rickshaw and lost control on the vehicle. About fifty students were travelling in it. The people from the nearby villages saved twenty-seven&#xD;&#xA;            students. The dead bodies of the drowned were recovered. It was a very painful sight.</p>&#xD;&#xA;        </article>&#xD;&#xA;        <article>&#xD;&#xA;          <h2 class="d_active tab_drawer_heading">Tab Content Four</h2>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>City life is full of fun. There are parks and picnic spots to visit. We have cinema halls to see movies. We have electricity which runs our factories, light and cools our home and helps us in seeing T.V. There are all type of amenities like water,&#xD;&#xA;            health check up and transport. Sometimes circus shows and magic shows entertain the city people.</p>&#xD;&#xA;          <p>I was lucky to escape death by a few seconds.' A bomb blasted in the compartment of Nilanchal Express. The overcrowded compartment made me to get down. Anyhow the loss was great. About ten people died and many got injured. It was the job of a terrorist.&#xD;&#xA;            The government should intensify searching operations in trains.1</p>&#xD;&#xA;        </article>&#xD;&#xA;      </div>&#xD;&#xA;    </section>
