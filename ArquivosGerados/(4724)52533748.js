Note down your max weight lifts.<br> After warming up with a lightweight barbel advance to your heaviest lift with as few sets as possible, performing 1 rep on each weight. A 1 rep max is&#xD;&#xA;        an attempt for PR, push yourself and be persistent considering that you have 1 attempt to succeed on your max weight. If you think that a failed PR attempt is due to bad warm up, drop down to 60% and advance to your heaviest lift again.</p>&#xD;&#xA;    </div>&#xD;&#xA;    <div class="wpb_wrapper">&#xD;&#xA;      This div barbel some text.&#xD;&#xA;    </div>&#xD;&#xA;    <div class="wpb_wrapper">&#xD;&#xA;      This div contains some text.&#xD;&#xA;    </div>
