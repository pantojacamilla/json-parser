He is the ONLY, and yes, ONLY rapper I will listen to. Because,&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     (a) His songs have meaning. They're not about sex and cars and bling blingin' rims.&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     (b) He has talent. He can actually rap. I don't think d12 is any good. =/&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     Anyway. I love this song and I'm getting his new CD right now... hehe.&#xD;&#xA;     <br/>&#xD;&#xA;     -Sarah&#xD;&#xA;     <div class="sign">
